# Solar-System-Project
Technologies Used: JavaScript, WebGL, GLSL, HTML, 3D Math, Shader Programming

For this project, I created an interactive 3D solar system using JavaScript and WebGL. It was a deep dive into graphics programming, and along the way, I learned a lot about how real-time 3D rendering works under the hood.

Here’s what I accomplished:

3D Scene – Built a full solar system from scratch, rendering planets that orbit and rotate in real time.

Shaders – Wrote custom GLSL vertex and fragment shaders to control lighting and surface appearance.

Geometry – Generated sphere meshes in code, including vertices, normals, and texture coordinates.

Animation – Used requestAnimationFrame to simulate realistic planetary motion.

Textures – Mapped high-res textures onto planets, including day/night and cloud layers for Earth.

Camera – Implemented interactive camera controls and perspective transformations.

Modular Code – Organized everything into reusable, clean utility functions for shaders and mesh creation.

This project really brought together everything from low-level GPU programming to high-level scene design. It helped me build confidence in WebGL, 3D math, and interactive graphics from the ground up.
